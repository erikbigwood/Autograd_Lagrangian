# Autograd_Lagrangian
 ***Comp Physics class project***
This is a project for PHY322 Spring 2025, applying modern machine-learning techniques to simulations of the Lagrangian formulation of classical mechanical systems.


Code located in "Code" folder

Documents/drafts located in the "LaTeX" folder.

The final presentation for PHY322 is contained in /LaTeX/Class Presentation/ and contains a pair of detailed progress reports, a PowerPoint presentation of background info, and several Jupyter notebooks with examples of the algorithm applied to a number of example physical systems:
    -Simple harmonic oscillator
    -2 particles in a harmonic potential with Coulomb interaction
        -Learning multiple parameterizations of the system -- exact Lagrangian, polynomial coupling (sum of products of powers of positions), neural network coupling
